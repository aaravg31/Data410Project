I am facing this difficult in understanding machine learning course which I took in the very first term(although I did machine learning course in my bachelors too but in home country and also machine learning in masters is a bit advanced course than that of I did in bachelors). So from the start I don't know why but I can't understand a single thing explained by the professor even though if I ask doubts in the end, still my head is confused I don't know why! is it because I am learning from a professor of a different country? Maybe a different perspective of teaching? Or maybe different ideas of explaining things? I don't know. I want to tackle this by learning by myself can you please suggest some sources which I can go through to understand this course maybe YouTube videos or online courses or maybe even books

So I just completed a PhD in astronomy, with a very computational project (CFD) but no ML. I have some personal projects but I feel limited in what I can do using only my personal laptop, so they're not particularly impressive analyses. I have Python, C++, HPC, Matlab, (some) SQL, matplotlib, and lots of other, more niche, technical skills/programs. I have a portfolio/GitHub + personal website that includes all of my projects, plus my thesis work. 

I know I lack industry experience so I'm mostly focussing on roles with an existing DS/SE team that I could learn from, but these are established companies so there's a lot of competition. Feedback I've gotten from interviews so far is basically that I speak very well but I don't have enough ML/AI/NLP experience, which I agree with. I would be willing to consider an internship, but they're all restricted to current students here in the UK and I was not permitted to take an internship during my PhD due to my visa, so I'm kinda stuck applying to jobs. 

So... I need industry experience in AI/ML/NLP to get a first job, but how do I get this without a job?

I lost my job this year. I was working as a data analyst for a marketing firm. It was a new team (I was hired before there was a data science team at all) and the manager of the team didn't have a strong statistics background. I only have a minor in data science so am pretty limited in my knowledge. I constantly felt like I would hit walls and had nowhere to turn for help. I stuck it out for 3 years but eventually was let go because I wasn't efficient enough (because I would get stuck worrying about things).

  
Now I'm trying to find a new job but I'm struggling to feel confident given my last experience. Is it unreasonable to want a job where I have a mentor and can ask for help. Does that exist? It seems like all the openings I see are looking for a expert rather than a novice. I feel like I know just enough to be terrified that I'm doing everything wrong. I know that there is a lot I can learn on my own but it seems like what I'm missing is stuff I can't learn by reading about data science.

For example, when I started at the marketing firm it was normal for us to run hundreds of hypothesis tests to look for significant differences between groups. It occured to me that could be a issue due to the multiple tests problem but nobody else was able to advise me so I was just left wondering. Reading about the multiple testing problem didn't help because I already knew what that was. What I needed was someone with experience who could say whether it was okay to go ahead and report the significant differences or not.

It is really hard to land Data scientist jobs at good companies as entry level, normally they ask for some relevant profesional experience, so I would aim for one of this two options:

\- Look for Data Scientist jobs at less renowed companies (Big ""Pymes"", consulting companies ""carnicas"",etc), gain some relevant technical experience and move to a bigger company after a while.

\- Look for Data Analyst/Business intelligence jobs at big companies, they dont tend to ask for a lot of experience for this kind of jobs, they will look in your CV and after two or three years you can try to transition to Data Scientist roles.

If you dont have professional experience maybe is easier to acces this jobs via an intership/graduate programs.

I would say that the market right now is good, some FAANG, fintech, banks, are hiring a lot of analytics related people.

That was my impression, too, albeit 3 years ago.



Companies don't need very many data scientists, however they often do need people who can design/implement the infrastructure. For many companies, data science only generates value when they've reached a certain level of data maturity. Not every company needs a DS, and for the rest I'd think that competition will be high or rather: the actually available position will be few.



Personally, I think projects are a good way to learn and grow but I'd suggest to try and do them at work, working with ""proper"" data. For many companies, the value of data work lies in leveraging the subject matter expertise and finding ways to find new insights and applications. Alternatively, value lies in data engineering - which you already figured out.



The way I approached Data Science, personally, was to find projects that were valuable for the company / department that I worked at. In short: implementing a database, doing the data cleaning and harmonisation, building a small business intelligence pipeline as well as the consulting and stakeholder work that I did along the way.


I don't want to overstate my work but in my small way my work transformed how my team and department operated on a daily basis. That generated better workflows and insights. You probably can only quantify some of the impact but my colleagues and bosses were happy for the change it brought, and found it valuable for their own work.


In the three domains of programming, statistics and subject matter expertise, I mostly leveraged the latter and added programming to my skill list. Advanced stats don't show up very often in my live of work.



My job today is niche but nowadays, I focus on the consulting, implementation and automation aspects. More specifically, I'd like to get people from working in their separate excel tables to more integrated workflows. My focus for the future for myself will probably be on Operations Research and algorithmic work.



> I tried to think about a few, but either: 1, the idea was done 100x already, so my project would be nothing new or 2, the data required would be too expensive to acquire.



Exactly, finding these usecases that are actually valuable is really difficult work! Being able to find that one usecase or that one aspect in a project that actually makes a difference is the key skill that makes a good data scientist.



That's also why DS jobs often aren't entry level but require previous working experience. If you can show within your current job that you can use your DS skills to do work that goes beyond the normal responsibilities and expectations for your role, then you can show that you can create true value for your team or department. Then you'll also have made a big step towards better employability. 


Any certificates that you work on will only be useful in so far as the skills you learn with them enable you to (better) create value for others.",0.997,3030,517,1,0,0,70.97555555555556,4,3,datascience,0,1,7321.0,1980.0

1,0,"> 1, the idea was done 100x already, so my project would be nothing new or 2, the data required would be too expensive to acquire.

In that case, could you look whether you could find a new application for 1)?

A project might be nothing special in some regard but it might be valuable if you find a new aspect or at a different data source to highlight a different angle on some topic. It might also be valuable when you apply a known solution somewhere where it hasn't been applied before, for some reason.

Or alternatively, could you try find alternative data sources for 2)? 

It's a very valid usecase to find a more economic way to run, say: an analysis. 

> I have nothing data related I could work on at my current place.

Is there no potential data storage solution or pipeline across several excel sheets that would improve some aspect of work? A faster availability of the same results maybe, a better visualisation or the incorporation of more data (e.g. from the web) or maybe a way to make data or information more easily digestible? It really needn't be a ""flashy"" project - not does it have to be prediction.

If you're looking for inspiration you could look at KNIME webinars, they showcase stuff from a lot of different industries.

To answer your question, yes, it's not going to be 4 explicit rounds/questions of Research Design AND Success Metrics AND Data Analysis AND programming in 45 minutes. Instead, it's going to be one or two SQL questions (for the programming round).

And then,one big question, probably around product metrics, but that'll also touch on Research Design & Data Analytics. Let me give you an example:

>Suppose you were to launch a new product, Facebook Dating. It's similar to Tinder/Hinge. What metrics would you look at, to see if the app is successful?

Here, you'd need to think about the UX/UI of the app, think about WHY Meta is making this app, and what metrics you might have after a month of it being out there in the market. To make it ""Research Design-y"", they could also ask you:

* how would you A/B test this app?
* what are some A/B testing issues you might run into?
* when is it even appropriate to A/B test a feature or not?

Or they may say, ""You launched the app, people seem to like it, but people who use it spend 1% less time on Meta for some reason. Should we launch it?"".

More examples of Product Sense / Product Metrics questions here:

[https://datalemur.com/blog/meta-data-scientist-interview-guide#Analytics-Reasoning-Questions](https://datalemur.com/blog/meta-data-scientist-interview-guide#Analytics-Reasoning-Questions)

This is also covered in-depth in Chapter 10 ""Product/Business Sense"" in [Ace the Data Science Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Ace-Data-Science-Interview-Questions/dp/0578973839) with 30 real interview questions from companies including Meta.

They'll also be a SQL question or two you'll have to answer. It may or MAY not relate to the product sense question. To practice for SQL, do the Meta tagged questions:

[https://datalemur.com/questions](https://datalemur.com/questions)

But, quite frankly, do all the Medium/Hard SQL questions since there's very little room for error or to be slow because of how competitive the job is and how objective it is to grade SQL performance.

Finally, to answer your last question:

>Also, I’m curious—does this format apply to all candidates for the Data Scientist, Product Analytics roles, or is it specific to candidates with doctoral degrees?

This format applies to all Meta Data Scientist, Product Analytics roles at the E3 (new grad) to e6 (staff level).

I lost my job this year. I was working as a data analyst for a marketing firm. It was a new team (I was hired before there was a data science team at all) and the manager of the team didn't have a strong statistics background. I only have a minor in data science so am pretty limited in my knowledge. I constantly felt like I would hit walls and had nowhere to turn for help. I stuck it out for 3 years but eventually was let go because I wasn't efficient enough (because I would get stuck worrying about things).

  
Now I'm trying to find a new job but I'm struggling to feel confident given my last experience. Is it unreasonable to want a job where I have a mentor and can ask for help. Does that exist? It seems like all the openings I see are looking for a expert rather than a novice. I feel like I know just enough to be terrified that I'm doing everything wrong. I know that there is a lot I can learn on my own but it seems like what I'm missing is stuff I can't learn by reading about data science.

For example, when I started at the marketing firm it was normal for us to run hundreds of hypothesis tests to look for significant differences between groups. It occured to me that could be a issue due to the multiple tests problem but nobody else was able to advise me so I was just left wondering. Reading about the multiple testing problem didn't help because I already knew what that was. What I needed was someone with experience who could say whether it was okay to go ahead and report the significant differences or not.

**2.** Does the University status matter, my course is accredited in Europe and all credits are ETCS, will employers be looking into that much or are they more likely to be looking at my portfolio of past projects?

1,0,"> 1, the idea was done 100x already, so my project would be nothing new or 2, the data required would be too expensive to acquire.

In that case, could you look whether you could find a new application for 1)?

A project might be nothing special in some regard but it might be valuable if you find a new aspect or at a different data source to highlight a different angle on some topic. It might also be valuable when you apply a known solution somewhere where it hasn't been applied before, for some reason.

Or alternatively, could you try find alternative data sources for 2)? 

It's a very valid usecase to find a more economic way to run, say: an analysis. 

> I have nothing data related I could work on at my current place.

Is there no potential data storage solution or pipeline across several excel sheets that would improve some aspect of work? A faster availability of the same results maybe, a better visualisation or the incorporation of more data (e.g. from the web) or maybe a way to make data or information more easily digestible? It really needn't be a ""flashy"" project - not does it have to be prediction.

If you're looking for inspiration you could look at KNIME webinars, they showcase stuff from a lot of different industries.

To answer your question, yes, it's not going to be 4 explicit rounds/questions of Research Design AND Success Metrics AND Data Analysis AND programming in 45 minutes. Instead, it's going to be one or two SQL questions (for the programming round).

And then,one big question, probably around product metrics, but that'll also touch on Research Design & Data Analytics. Let me give you an example:

>Suppose you were to launch a new product, Facebook Dating. It's similar to Tinder/Hinge. What metrics would you look at, to see if the app is successful?

Here, you'd need to think about the UX/UI of the app, think about WHY Meta is making this app, and what metrics you might have after a month of it being out there in the market. To make it ""Research Design-y"", they could also ask you:

* how would you A/B test this app?
* what are some A/B testing issues you might run into?
* when is it even appropriate to A/B test a feature or not?

Or they may say, ""You launched the app, people seem to like it, but people who use it spend 1% less time on Meta for some reason. Should we launch it?"".

More examples of Product Sense / Product Metrics questions here:

[https://datalemur.com/blog/meta-data-scientist-interview-guide#Analytics-Reasoning-Questions](https://datalemur.com/blog/meta-data-scientist-interview-guide#Analytics-Reasoning-Questions)

This is also covered in-depth in Chapter 10 ""Product/Business Sense"" in [Ace the Data Science Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Ace-Data-Science-Interview-Questions/dp/0578973839) with 30 real interview questions from companies including Meta.

They'll also be a SQL question or two you'll have to answer. It may or MAY not relate to the product sense question. To practice for SQL, do the Meta tagged questions:

[https://datalemur.com/questions](https://datalemur.com/questions)

But, quite frankly, do all the Medium/Hard SQL questions since there's very little room for error or to be slow because of how competitive the job is and how objective it is to grade SQL performance.

Finally, to answer your last question:

>Also, I’m curious—does this format apply to all candidates for the Data Scientist, Product Analytics roles, or is it specific to candidates with doctoral degrees?

This format applies to all Meta Data Scientist, Product Analytics roles at the E3 (new grad) to e6 (staff level).
